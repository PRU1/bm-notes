# Business Management HL Notes
My repository of IB Business Management Notes. My notes were taken primarily from InThinking, but there are a few places where I used [this YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@lewwinski) or [Paul Hoang's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@paulhoang88/videos).

These notes **are not complete**. I would use these notes to quickly find a key term, and supplement it with your textbook. The best place to learn the content is from a good textbook and your teacher.

For the most functionality, use the search bar in the top right. I didn't create many backlinks while making this vault (I did not know what Obsidian was...) so your best bet is to search specific topics for more info.

Also note that Units 1 and 3 were taken in Word and not markdown, which is why their formatting is particularly janky. Units 2, 4, 5 are better quality.
