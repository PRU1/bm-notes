|**Implications:** _Discuss what your research contributes to our understanding of the issue or problem stated in the RQ. For instance, “If the problem continues…” or “If the problem is addressed…”_|
||
|**Answer the question:** _Refer back to the research question and answer the entirety of the RQ. Try to finish with a strong statement._|

|**Limitations:** _Discuss the limitations of your research (including the SDs). Are there any unanswered questions? What else, if anything, is needed to research further?_|

Recommended Format: (copy pasted from InThinking)
**1. Introduction**

- Brief background information about the chosen business organization. This provides the **context** of the business research project.
    
- Outline of the contemporary, real-world issue or problem under investigation (to provide context).
    
- Rationale for the study, including choice of key concept.
    
- Relevance of the chosen key **concept** to the research question.
    
- Description of the methodology used to investigate the chosen issue or problem. This should include an outline of the relevant tools and theories, i.e., the **contents** of the syllabus most relevant to the RQ.
    

---

**2.  Body**

- Main findings (from the 3 - 5 supporting documents).
    
- Analysis of the findings (in relation to the research question).
    
- Application of relevant Business Management tools, theories, techniques, and terminology.
    
- Integration of the chosen [key concept](https://www.student.thinkib.net/businessmanagement/page/42758/the-4-key-concepts "New syllabus (first teaching 2022) » The 4 key concepts").
    
- Evidence of evaluation (critical thinking) in relation to:
    

1. Why and how the information in the 3 - 5 supporting documents are helpful (or unhelpful) in addressing the research question
    
2. Strengths and limitations of the data/information in the 3 - 5 supporting documents with respect to answering the research question.
    
3. An evaluative approach to the discussions, e.g., the short-term and long-term implications of the findings on the chosen business organization, including the impact on employees, customers, or other key stakeholder groups, as well as its finances.
    

---

**3.  Conclusion**

- Provide a clear and explicit answer to the research question, backed by the evidence presented in the main body of the research project.
    
- Do not introduce any new materials, facts, or arguments that have not been discussed in body of the research project.
    
- Acknowledge any aspect of the research question that has not been fully addressed from the findings and analysis of the research project, outlining any further investigation needed to answer the research question more effectively.


To what extent has Apple's vertical integration of hardware impacted the profitability of their Mac line up?

Arguments: 
- improve image of product (probably remove this point)
	- in control of brand image of product, because now you are in direct control how much each generate improves by, since you vertically integrate hardware and software (ok but relate to profitability)

- get a competitive advantage: not have to rely on chip manufacturers for innovation
- porter's generic strategies
	- point of Porter's strategy is to outline strategies to have a competitive advantage
	- Apple's 4 strategies for a competitive advantage:

- you see cost leadership --> extend idea to profitability, don't have to pay extra to companies like intel to manufacture chips, reduced overhead costs
	- but now there are higher R&D costs and random costs with finding manufacturers, etc.
	
- do a contribution analysis (if can find data!)

- how do these translate into the public perception of product (i.e. will people actually purchase it)
	- stakeholder analysis [Apple_M1_Spotlight.pdf (totaleconomicimpact.com)](https://tools.totaleconomicimpact.com/go/apple/tei//docs/Apple_M1_Spotlight.pdf) 
	- [TEI-of-Mac-in-Enterprise.pdf (totaleconomicimpact.com)](https://tools.totaleconomicimpact.com/go/apple/TEI/docs/TEI-of-Mac-in-Enterprise.pdf) 
	- more secure devices
	- makes high performance devices more accessible to all workers
		- they want to buy into apple's other products (i.e. app store) because it is all vertically integrated

Conclusion:
- helps Apple continue to be profitable, hard to say at this stage if it had a direct increase/decrease in profitability.
- Also COVID, so financial data cannot be taken completely accurately
- indirectly positively impacts profitability
