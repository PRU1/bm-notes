crisis management - how a business responds to crisis

1. **transparency**
- be honest to stakeholders.
- people take bad news better than forgiving. people do not like being lied to
- CSR!
2. **communication**
- internal communication - help employees know what is going on
- with public (i.e. VW car emissions scandal)
3. **speed**
- return back to original operations ASAP
- slow response can prolong and worsen the crisis. don't make rushed decisions though
4. **control**
- some crises can be preventable
- you got to take control over crisis --> i.e. fire drill
- improved security measures
- *clear leadership*
