## collective bargaining
- negotiation of working conditions and pay between employer and employees
- or their representatives (trade unions!)
## work to rule
- all employees follow all rules
- reduces labour productivity and firm competence --> workers not allowed to do any overtime
- force employer to listen to what the workers want (i.e. teachers doing no ECs)
## strike action
refusal by employees to work
puts pressure on employers to fix issue
not paid during strike
very disruptive
