Primary research (see [[4.4 Why and how organizations carry out market research]]) is about first hand data.
- surveys
- interviews
- focus groups
- observations

## Surveys
advantages:
- lets researchers get large amounts of data quickly
- online surveys are cheap (compared to interviews)

disadvantages:
- face to face surveys are expensive and time consuming
- interview bias (i.e. from poorly worded questions). can generate unrepresentative results
- open ended questions are time consuming to answer (surveys can be time consuming!)
- people may not answer truthfully

## Interviews
advantages:
- good for qualitative data
- interview can clarify with follow up questions
disadvantages:
- small amount of people sampled
- interviewer bias
- time consuming and therefore costly

## Focus groups
- get a bunch of people with similar characteristics (i.e. age, gender) or interests (i.e. GAMERS, food critics). You put them in a group to discuss questions
advantages:
- identify desires of a specific market segment
- get opinion and attitude of customers
disadvantages:
- money, participants are paid to participate
- not representative of entire market
- peer pressure to give polite answers

## Observations
- stalk customers and see how they behave and react to certain situations
advantages:
- participants don't have to be willing to partake in it
- accurate and realistic results; removes bias!
disadvantages
- time consuming
- if subjects know they are being monitored than they act differently
