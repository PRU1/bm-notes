**The Role of finance:**

Business spends money on capital or revenue expenditures

Capital expenditure: cost of equipment, fixed assets, doesn’t make you money

**Not enough money?** Cut on expenditures. Biggest ones to cut: salaries and advertising and promotions

-          See where revenue is coming from (surveys) and decide which ads to cut

**Business Management Toolkit: Contribution Analysis**

Used as a decision making tool to:

1.       make or buy something

2.       Contribution costing

3.       Absorption costing

-          Another example: contract or hire an employee. Contract doesn’t have the overhead costs (i.e.

-          Chicken tacos are making you the most money (lowest variable cost per unit production)

Unit contribution = Price (of unit) – AVC (average variable cost). Average variable cost: cost to make taco (transport)

_Total Contribution_

Total contribution = TFC / unit contribution

Total fixed cost: cost of running business (i.e. rent). Total contribution tells you the minimum number of units to buy to break even

_Buy and Make Decision_

Cost to buy: price * quantity

Cost to make: fixed cost + (variable costs * quantity)

_Qualitative factos in make or buy decisions_

Break-even quantity: Fixed cost / unit contribution

If it doesn’t make sense to sell 375 vegan tacos, absorption costs can tell you how many more chicken tacos you need to sell to make up for the vegan ones.
