Ratio analysis: a way to analyse the financial performance of a business.
Three things:
- Gross profit margin
- Profit margin
- Return on capital employed (ROCE)
$$\text{gross profit margin} = \frac{\text{gross profit}}{\text{sales revenue}}\times 100$$
- Net profit: gross profit - overhead costs
- You want a high gpm
- How to get a higher GPM:
	- Increase sales revenue and reduce direct costs
		- i.e. launching products with higher gross profit margin
		- Reduce price of product and sell at a higher volume
		- Outsource production to places where labour is cheap
Profit margin ratio:
$$\text{profit margin} =\frac{\text{profit before interest and tax}}{\text{sales revenue}} \times 100$$
Profit: financial surplus after the payment of all overhead costs.
How to increase profit margin: reduce overhead costs
- Insurance, lease payments, mortgage payments, phone+internet, rent, salaries for cost centers, utility bills

- Measures the profitability when compared to its size (value of employed capital)
- ![[Pasted image 20230523234214.png]]
- how much money you get for the capital expenditure in a product (kind of)
- How to improve ROCE:
	- increase sales revenue
	- Reduce cost of production
	- Sell unproductive, unused, underused, and obsolete assets (to improve operational efficiency)
Non-current liabilities: long term debts of an organization that's raised through loan capital (such as mortgages and long term borrowing)
