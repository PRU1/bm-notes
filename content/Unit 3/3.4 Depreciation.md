- The price of an asset reduces with time
	- wear and tear, new versions of the same asset
- Depreciation is recorded in profit and loss account as a business expense. Also on the balance sheet "to reflect the fall in the market value of the asset"
- you can sell depreciated assets for their residual value. Some times the residual value is 0
- There are two ways to measure depreciation
	1. straight line method
	2. units of production method
#### Straight line method
- the value of the asset falls by the same amount each year

- ![[Pasted image 20230530112946.png]]
##### Advantages
- easy to calculate
- good for assets that have a known shelf life (like batteries or cereal)
- Accurate for assets that are used regularly (i.e. furniture) over their lifetime
- Easy for historical comparisons of data, since the depreciation value is the same each year
##### Disadvantages
- Not all assets depreciate uniformly (i.e. cars depreciate the most right when you drive away with them)
- Assets do not depreciate uniformly because they have higher repair/maintenance costs (i.e. cars, machinery)
- Not suitable if you cannot estimate the life span of the product
### Units of production method
- calculates depreciation based on usage of an asset
- so a car would depreciate more if you drive more km on it

- units of production means the expected output from the machine

##### Advantages
- more accurate to use this method
- More accurate for non-current assets that depreciate due to wear and tear, not just passage of time
##### Disadvantages
