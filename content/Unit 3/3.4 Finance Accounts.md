Profit and loss account: taxes and interest in not included in expenses, since different places have different taxes and interest rates. Keeping them two separate sections is helpful for comparing profit/loss sheets for MNCs

Financial accounts – Balance sheets

Assets: business possessions that have monetary value. Owned by business

Liabilities: stuff the business owes to other people

Balance sheet has two things: sources of finances and uses of finance.

Non current assets: not going to be sold in the next 12 months (i.e. buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles). Most of the values of these items fall over time (this is known as depreciation)

Illiquid assets: cannot be sold quickly without losing a lot of money

Current assets: you want to turn into money quickly, within the next 12 months. Can include

-          Cash, debtors (people who will pay debt to you), stocks, raw materials, work-in-progress (partially completed goods), finished goods

n  What does this mean?

You don’t have to pay interest to shareholders (one less expense to worry about)

No debt or interest payments

Any public limited liability company can make further finance by selling more shares

_Disadvantages_

Shareholders need to be paid dividends once the company earns a profit (booooo)

Dilution of company ownership (when you sell shares, you’re selling a part of your ownership)

Only an option for public limited companies à what’s public limited company again?
