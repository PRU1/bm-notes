## collective bargaining
working together to come to a mutually beneficial outcome
## threat of redundancies
cut staff when certain job roles are no longer needed
puts pressure for employees to be better and resolve industrial unrest
## change of contract
change terms and conditions of employment for the employees. has to be in accordance to legal system. give workers advance notice prior to renewal contract. worst case no change to contract to annoying (disruptive) employees

## closure and lock outs
closure --> employer mad at employee and shuts down the business. encourages workers to renegotiate since they've got no income now
lock-out --> employers shut out their employees, don't let them work. very hostile and damaging to their corporate image
