[[5.5 Break Even Analysis]]

![[Pasted image 20231206084107.png]]

Contribution: (total contribution and contribution per unit) - way of understanding break-even analysis
**contribution per unit** = P-AVC

**Total contribution** = (contribution per unit) * quantity
Profit = total contribution - TFC (total fixed costs)
###### common mistake
- contribution is not the same as value added
- unit contribution = price - avc
- value added per unit = price - atc (average total cost)
