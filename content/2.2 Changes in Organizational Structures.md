- different organizational structures got to change [[2.2 Organizational structure]]
2 types of flexible organizational structures

1. project based organization
2. Shamrock organization
- external factors can change organizational structure

## project based organization
- based on needs of some project
- project run by project manager PM
	- in charge of team of project
	- holds responsibility over the entire project
	- members from all over
	- after project is done, disband and join another project or go to their departments
	- lets company be responsive to market demand for new products
	- matrix structure
	- bad: cultural differences
## shamrock organization
three parts. Handy says organizations got to adapt to survive (this seems obvious...)
1. professional core
2. contingent workforce (peripheral)
3. outsourced vendors

### professional core
full time experts. essential to meet organizational objectives
Handy predicts ICT would reduce professional core
### contingent workforce
- temporary staff hired by organization
- made up of portfolio workers, part time, seasonal, people on flexitime
- supermarkets use contingent workforce
### outsourced vendors
- hired on contract to carry specific but non core role
	- security catering accounting marketing
	- not managed directly by business, greater autonomy
Shamrock say: have multiskilled work outsourced. core workforce should focus on core functions (what the business does best). Everything else should be outsourced. only full time workers get perks
