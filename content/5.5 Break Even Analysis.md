- determine the level of sales needed to recover costs associated with output of a good or service

## Limitations

1. prices are assumed to be constant. Many businesses offer price discounts to people who buy in bulk
2. costs are assumed to be constant. Not true (think of economies of scale!)
3. Changes in external business environment will impact costs and revenue
4. BEA is ideal for firms that sell a single good or service. Hard to calculate BEA for multiple products
5. Relies on accuracy of cost and revenue data to make predictions. Mistakes/inaccuracies create bias which could invalidate the results
6. Ignores qualitative considerations
