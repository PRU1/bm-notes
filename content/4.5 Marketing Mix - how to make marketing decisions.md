# price

pricing strategies
1. cost plus
average cost + markup
1. penetration
charge really low prices to attract customers
increase sales and awareness
low profitability and brand value (cheap, low quality products)
1. loss leader
sell certain products as a loss 
- attract potential customers, works well for FMCG, causes brand switching
- works only if customers purchase other products too, otherwise you're in loss (disadvantage)
1. predatory
DANGEROUS PRICE WARS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
work short term
- increased market share, and high entry barrier
- can result in a MONOPOLYYYYYYY
bads
- not sustainable long term, unethical/illegal
- profitability is at a risk
1. premium 
- setting a high price for premium high quality products
advantages - high margins, good brand value
- low sales value, does not apply to every product (con)
1. dynamic
- price changes based on circumstance
- adv: flexibilyt, chance to maximze profits (i.e. gas prices)
- dis: not applicalble to many products (can cause customer dissatisfaction (i.e. high price for umbrella when it rains))
1. competitive 
- lower/increase price product based on compitors
- ensures sales encourgase brand loyalty
- reliance on competitive (i.e. companies may use predatory pricing, bad for you, ) not sustainable long term
1. contribution
price - AVC 
- profitability is ensured, your price is higher than AVC
- disregards competitors price (disadvantage) not offer a competitive price
PED
- you change the price, demand chance
- Inelastic (0 - 1), price change does not change demand much
- Unit elastic 1: % change in price equals % change in demand cange
- elastic > 1 (small change in price greatly affects demands)
Promotion
- communicate messages about product/brand to the customers
