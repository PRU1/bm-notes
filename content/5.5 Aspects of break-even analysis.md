[[5.5 Break Even Analysis]] involves:

1. break even quantity point
2. profit or loss
3. margin of safety
4. target profit output
5. target profit
6. target price


break-even analysis gives managers+entrepreneurs info and forecasts about firm's cost, revenues and profits
- easily interpreted
- reduce high risk decisions
BEP break even point = when TR (total revenue) intersects TC (total costs)
BER

positive margin of safety: earn more than BEQ

## Target Profit Output
target profit quantity = (fixed cost + target cost) / (price - average variable cost)
Target profit: value of profit that they aim to achieve
Target price: average fixed cost + average variable cost
or 
target price = (total fixed cost / output) + average variable cost
**target price beyond break even**
target price = (target profit + total cost) / quantity of output
Target profit = (Price $\times$ quantity) - \[ fixed cost + (average variable cost $\times$ quantity)] or target profit = Total revenue - Total cost
