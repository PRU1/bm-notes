## JIT
- lean production method of stock control
- deliveries of stock just in time for them to be used in production process
- removes cost of buffer stocks
- eliminates storage, reduces insurance, and maintenance
- continuous improvement, difficult to manage for big organizations
- stock is delivered right after required for production
- working capital is not tied up in inventory, which might not be liquid

STORAGE COSTS

- insurance
- wastage
- security (for theft prevention)
- maintenance 
- damage

- customers don't have to wait for product 
**disadvantages**
- costs --> insurance and maintenance + security of stocks
- subject to damage or theft
- stockpiling reduces cash flow + working capital
- suppliers can charge high prices for urgent deliveries of stock
- unsuitable for perishable products (i.e. food)
