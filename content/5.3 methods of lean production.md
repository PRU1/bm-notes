2. JIT
## Kaizen
make iterative small improvements in many production processes
- employees receptive to small and incremental changes rather than big changes
- time consuming and expensive (schedule meetings, cost of staff training, upskilling)

- emphasize process improvement
- eliminate waste
- teamwork!
- empower employees - acknowledge employee expertise
- big data + data analysis
- incremental improvements
- promote process standardization
- pursuit of perfection
- customer orientation
- embrace change

## JIT
- don't stockpile. build and ship off
advantages
- no need for buffer stocks
- avoids stockpiling (insurance storage costs)
- improve liquidity
- foster lean production
disadvantage
- high admin and implementation costs as orders are placed in small quantities
- does not let a firm enjoy economies of scale
- risk of running out of stock
- reliant on 3rd party suppliers to deliver parts on time
