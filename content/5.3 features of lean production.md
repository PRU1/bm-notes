two features
- less waste
- greater efficiency

1. Less waste: 8 sources of waste DOWNTIME
Defects
Overproduction (wasted assets)
Waiting times (delays in production process)
Non-utilized talents or resources: creates inefficiencies
Transportation: unnecessary and expensive transportation
Inventory: stockpiling assets. - insurance and maintenance, risk being stolen
Motion: worker movement between workstations, wastes time and reduces labour productivity
Excess processing: does not add value to a product but drives up cost

2. Efficiency
- use resources productively to generate output
	- sales per person
	- output per worker
	- output per machine hour
	- average costs per unit of output
- increase efficiency through
	- employee motivation
	- improve technologies
	- improved training for employees
