## internal factors
1. size of organization --> bigger organizations need more HR (i.e. more training)
2. strategic direction of organization --> i.e. if growth is priority
3. Organizational structural --> HR can figure out redundancies
4. Finances --> got to have enough money to keep and hire people
5. Motivation --> low motivation = high labour turnover rate
6. Corporate culture --> want good culture
## external factors
1. demographic change: study of population and population trends
	- things like average age of population, ethnicity distribution, gender distribution, education levels, household incomes, retirement age
2. Change in labour mobility
	- how much workers want to move between locations for their employment
		- occupational mobility: willingness of employee to switch jobs. occupational immobility --> rules and regulations
		- geographical mobility: how much an employee wants to relocate to another location for work. i.e. truck drivers must travel long distances
		- hard to get international mobility of labour
		- improve labour mobility by offering improved pay and benefits
3. Immigration
	- migrant workers
	- expatriates --> foreign workers, go for salaries
	- advantages of expatriates
		- ease skills shortages; use when you cannot find local skilled workers
		- flexible work structures: migrants are willing to work at different times
		- marketing opportunities: they can give niche marketing ideas
		- personnel opportunities: new ideas
		- Net social benefits: migrant workers pay income tax
4. Flexi-time
	- workers work some hours and choose when to work, as long as their work gets completed
	- used to maintain work-life balance
	- potential lack of accountability and productivity
5. Gig economy
	- short term, or one-off contracts
	- advantages of gig economy
		- worker freedom and flexibility. Choice of part time employment
		- significant income when you work multiple jobs
		- better work life balance
		- businesses have lower cost of production, because don't have to pay benefits
		- lower costs of production for business = more price competitive products
	- disadvantages
		- reduces need for full time workers in traditional economy, limits career development (potentially -->bad point but it's in InThinking so ok?)
		- don't have fixed employment contracts, lacks job security and stable income
		- start up costs (i.e. car to Uber)
		- no benefits
		- got to be tech savvy to benefit from gig economy
