See [[3.9 Difference between cost and profit centres]] for what profit/cost centres are

PROFIT = revenue - total costs for some period of time
If costs are greater than revenue your company is in loss

WHY WE LIKE PROFITS
- incentive to produce
- reward for risk taker
- encourages invention and innovation
- is an indicator of growth or decline
- INTERNAL SOURCE OF FINANCE

- non profit companies want a financial surplus.

you can remember the roles of cost and profit centres with MAMA
**M**: Monitoring and control
**A**: Autonomy
**M**: Motivating
**A**: Accountability

- MEANS a company is able to operate effectively and make informed decisions

LIMITATIONS
- unhealthy competition between different departments inside a business
- loss of control: if profit/cost centres control their money, managers get less control
- Subjectivity: how to run cost/profit centres may make people have arguments (oh no)
- Short-termism: encourages managers to think short term. You lose the long term vision of a business, and may neglect spending money on HR or R&D
